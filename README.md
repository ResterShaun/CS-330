1.	How do I approach designing software?

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

My work on the project helped me get better acquainted with establishing the vertices and meshes while working with compound objects involving 2 primitives as well as multiple textures.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

Based off the source code we received from the master files it was a lot of troubleshooting and running tests. Trial and error was the name of the game using the code I was given and changing it to the shapes I required. Once I got the shapes established it was just making small fixes and cleaning up my code/comments.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Usage of iteration and reusability will always be applied in future work for me. It not only helped me work through the steps to get the code running but it gave me a ton of insight to help me save time while still producing quality code.

2.	How do I approach developing programs?

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I really focused on reusability while working on this scene. Utilizing the milestone and assignment code that worked in my favor and integrating it into my projects scene was extremely beneficial.
	
 How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration played a key factor in my development of the app. Utilizing it for my lights, meshes, as well as my textures.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

With the initial development of the code I was focusing on repetition to help me learn the process of each step trying to be proactive and work the knowledge from the milestones and assignments straight into my project folder and work through them side by side throughout the entire process.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

They helped me really nail down the process of working a few lines and checking for errors. Having never worked with 3d Design I really had to take my time and break every step down which I think will benefit me in the future after utilizing it successfully for these tasks I thought I would struggle with.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Depending on what company or job I end up finding myself in there is a chance that at some point 3d graphics or rendering could come into play. Having some basic knowledge about the subjects will make it easier to integrate into my future work projects.
